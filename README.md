# Salary Prediction Based on qualification and other job descriptions

Salary Prediction in Python. Leveraging job postings with salaries to build a regression model to predict salaries for new job postings.

1. Project Summary:

The main objective of this project is to:

a. Investigate relationships between different attributes of job postings like salaries, educational qualification, industry, work experience etc.

b. Based on the results create a regression model which can accurately predict salaries for job posting with a certain degreee of accuracy.

The data set is provided in two csv files 'train_features.csv' which contains attributes of each job posting and 'train_salaries.csvâ€™ that has salaries for each corresponding job posting.
