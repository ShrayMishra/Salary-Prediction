# Salary Prediction Based on qualification and other job descriptions

Salary Prediction in Python. Leveraging job postings with salaries to build a regression model to predict salaries for new job postings.

## 1. Project Summary:

The main objective of this project is to:

a. Investigate relationships between different attributes of job postings like salaries, educational qualification, industry, work experience etc.

b. Based on the results create a regression model which can accurately predict salaries for job posting with a certain degreee of accuracy.

The data set is provided in two csv files 'train_features.csv' which contains attributes of each job posting and 'train_salaries.csvâ€™ that has salaries for each corresponding job posting.

## 3. Performance Evaluation

Average Mean Squared Error (MSE) for different Regressors:

### Linear Regression: 384.448

### Random Forest:     368.728

### Gradient Boosting: 398.564

The best performing regressor for this model is Random Forest with lowest MSE of 368.728

## 4. Software
IDE: Jupyter and Spyder
Python Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikitlearn

## 5. Conclusion

We can derive from this Salary Prediction project that most job postings and their salaries can be predicted by combining job attributes. 

a. It can also help applicants with their salary expectations based on parameters like  years of experience, educational qualifications, industry miles from Metropolis among others. For instance, miles from Metropolis is a strong indicator for high salaries and a candidate can make a chocie between moving closer to a Metropolis or just finding a job near his/her place. 

b. Another intresting finding form this project is that investing in higher education will lead to better salaries as people with low salaries are the one who with low education qualifications. It results in lowest mean salaries regardless of the industry.

c. The model lacks in predecting salaries which lie in the upper echelon of the dataset. In the distribution of Predicted values, it is almost symmetrical but the actual values distribution is skewed to the right. Prection for salaries ends around 240 on the Salary axis while actual salaries go well over 250. The reason behind this lies in the fact that these high salaries are paid to C-level executives and there are number of other factors which come into play while predicting salaries in the upper echelon details about which is not present in the current dataset.
